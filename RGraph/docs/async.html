    <h1>RGraph: HTML5 canvas graph library - Asynchronous processing</h1>

    <script>
        if (document.all) {
            document.write('<div style="background-color: #fee; border: 2px dashed red; padding: 5px"><b>Important</b><br /><br /> Internet Explorer does not natively support the HTML5 canvas tag yet, so if you want to see the graphs, you can either:<ul><li>Install <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a></li><li>Use ExCanvas. This is provided in the RGraph Archive.</li><li>Use another browser entirely. Your choices are Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 2+, Safari 4+ or Opera 10.5+. </li></ul></div>');
        }
    </script>
    
    <p>
        Asynchronous processing can speed up the display of your graphs, because the browser gets to your code, sets it
        going and then continues on rendering the page. Particularly if you have a weighty page,
        it can make quite a difference. The <i>RGraph.Async()</i> function itself is very simple, but because it can make
        a significant difference to the speed of your page, it is documented here. There's an example of it below. The
        front page also uses it. One thing to remember is to ensure your canvas tag is defined first before you set the
        function that creates the graph going.
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.js"&gt;&lt;script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;script&gt;

&lt;canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="100"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;canvas&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    /**
    * Create the line graph
    */
    function CreateLineGraph ()
    {
        line = new RGraph.Line('myCanvas', [1,2,4,2,1,3,5,6,6,5,3,5]);
        line.Set('chart.title', 'Sales for Acme Inc.');
        line.Set('chart.labels', ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']);
        line.Draw();
    }

    RGraph.Async(CreateLineGraph);
&lt;script&gt;
</pre>

    <p><b>Things to remember</b></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>All your libraries must be loaded first. In the pages &lt;head&gt; for example. If not, you won't be able to create your graphs.</li>
        <li>Your &lt;canvas&gt; tag must be defined before setting the asynchronous code going. If not, then the canvas may be referenced before it exists, and thus your graphs will not be created.</li>
        <li>
            The users connection speed may be a factor. Slower connections may mean, for example, that the onload event doesn't fire very
            quickly. If you're using the onload event to create your graphs then asynchronous creation instead may give you more
            apparent speed ups. Alternatively, careful placement of the &lt;canvas&gt; tag and the code that creates the graph may suffice
            instead.
        </li>
        <li>Since the MSIE/ExCanvas combo requires you to use the window.onload event, aynchronous graph creation in this case will probably not be any help.</li>
        <li>
            Since a dev release of version 4, Google Chrome has had an issue when aynchronous processing is used, meaning that
            text isn't always displayed. The solution here is simply to not use asynchronous processing.
        </li>
    </ul>
