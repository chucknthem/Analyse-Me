        if (document.all) {
            document.write('<div style="background-color: #fee; border: 2px dashed red; padding: 5px"><b>Important</b><br /><br /> Internet Explorer does not natively support the HTML5 canvas tag yet, so if you want to see the graphs, you can either:<ul><li>Install <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a></li><li>Use ExCanvas. This is provided in the RGraph Archive.</li><li>Use another browser entirely. Your choices are Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 2+, Safari 4+ or Opera 10.5+. </li></ul></div>');

    <h4>Canvas fallback content and visually impaired users</h4>

    <p>
        When using the canvas element you should be aware of the accessibility of your graphs, for example where vision limited users are
        concerned. Screen readers, for example, may not be able to convert a graph into something that is reasonable, so you should
        consider
        doing this yourself, possibly using the canvas fallback content (ie the content in between canvas tags). A possible example
        would be to put a table of data inside the canvas tag that the graph on the canvas represents. Doing this goes a long way
        towards making the data available to everyone. You might also wish to consider using the full canvas zoom to enable people
        to enlarge the graph.
    </p>

    <h4>Using a DIVs contents as a tooltip</h4>

    <p>
        Instead of supplying the HTML in your Javascript, which may get a little unwieldy, you can also specify the ID of a DIV
        that should be used as the tooltip. Instead of giving the HTML, simply specify (for example) <b>id:myDiv</b> as your tooltip,
        and RGraph will attempt to use that DIVs contents as the tooltip. Eg:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">myBar.Set('chart.tooltips', ['id:myDiv', ...])</pre>
    
    <p>
        Only the content of the DIV is used (ie the .innerHTML), not the DIV itself. So any CSS that you apply to it will be ignored.
        This does mean however that you can safely set <i>display: none</i> on it, so that it's not visible to the user. An example of
        this method in action is the first <a href="../examples/line.html">line chart</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Upper and lower limits for horizontal bars</h4>

    <p>
        If you don't wish to specify an upper or lower limit for horizontal bars, and you just want them to extend to the upper or lower
        limits of the graph, whatever they may be, you can specify null for the value determining how far they extend. For cases where
        the X axis is in the middle and you're specifying a negative start value, or you want the bar to extend all the way to the
        bottom, you can simply specify an arbitrary length (eg -999999). Eg:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">myBar.Set('chart.background.hbars', [[0, null, 'green'], [0,-999999,'red']]);</pre>
    
    <h4>Setting the canvas width and height</h4>
    
    <p>
        To set the canvas width and height you must use the HTML width/height attributes and NOT CSS. If you do use CSS, the canvas
        will be scaled, and not enlarged, to fit the new width/height. Eg:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">&lt;canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;canvas&gt;</pre>
    
    <p />
    
    <h4>RGraph and older browsers</h4>
    
    <p>
        Older versions of browsers are supported (assuming they have canvas support), however, if they don't support the canvas text
        or shadow APIs these will naturally be unavailable. The graphs will still be drawn, though without shadows or text.
    </p>
    
    <h4>RGraph and Microsoft Internet Explorer</h4>
    
    <p>
        You can now use RGraph with Internet Explorer 8 in conjunction with ExCanvas, (which brings a degree of &lt;canvas&gt; support to MSIE).
        Bear in mind though that shadows are not available and thus are simulated.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Debugging tips</h4>

    <p>
        If you're having a hard time debugging your graph, try these:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have only one graph on the page</li>
        <li>Make sure you have disabled your web browsers cache (the Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">Web Developer toolbar</a> can do this for Firefox)</li>
        <li>Try using <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com" target="_blank">Firebug</a> (for Firefox)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Double click context menus</h4>

    <p>
        Windows Opera, Windows Safari, Mac Safari and Mac Firefox all attach the context menu to the double click event (left mouse button),
        not the right, in order to make it more reliable.
    </p>
